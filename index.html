              The most-talked about horse in the world, came, saw and conquered
              the dressage with his rider Edward Gal. Together they won the
              heart of millions all over the world, winning three titles at the
              FEI World Equestrian Games and setting multiple record scores in
              Kentucky in 2010. An extreme sum of money, somewhere between 10
              and 15 million, caused the stallion to move to Germany.

              The Royal Ballet School launches a new on Demand platform that
              makes their teaching available to all dance students, wherever
              they are, for the first time. Classes taught by expert Royal
              Ballet School teachers can be viewed on any device and all
              exercises have been carefully designed to be executed in a smaller
              space than a ballet studio and without specialist equipment, so
              are perfect to do at home.
